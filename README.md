# Sridhar Ravi Kumar . Jarvis Consulting

Data Engineering professional with hands-on experience building backend applications and data processing systems at Jarvis Consulting Group. I have worked with Java, Linux, Bash, Docker, PostgreSQL, and SQL to build tools such as a containerized Java Grep application and a Linux cluster monitoring system. Previously at Cognizant, I worked on downstream data processing using COBOL-based batch programs, handled file-based data flows, supported month-end operations, and created productivity reports. I enjoy understanding systems end-to-end, writing clear code, and improving reliability through better design and data structure choices.

**Linux Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SridharRaviKumar/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Bash-based monitoring tool to collect hardware specifications and resource usage from Linux machines. Designed PostgreSQL schemas for host and usage data, automated data collection using Cron, and containerized the database with Docker. Wrote SQL queries to analyze system usage and support operational insights.

**Java Grep Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_SridharRaviKumar/tree/master/core_java/grep)]: Built a Java-based Grep application to search large text files using regular expressions. Implemented file traversal using Java NIO and Streams, applied lambda expressions for filtering and processing, and added logging with SLF4J. Packaged the application as a fat JAR using Maven and containerized it with Docker to ensure consistent execution across environments.


## Highlighted Projects
**FitEats AI Meal Planner** [[GitHub](https://github.com/sridhoo/)]: Designed a simple meal-planning application that recommends food options based on user preferences. Built basic automation features such as calorie-range filters and dynamic meal suggestions. Explored the use of AI-assisted components to improve recommendations and experimented with lightweight deployment using AWS and containerized workflows. Focused on building a clean user flow, responsive interface, and easy-to-maintain backend structure.

**Sales Performance Dashboard** [[GitHub](https://github.com/sridhoo/)]: Created a Power BI dashboard to track sales performance across regions. Converted manual Excel reports into automated dashboards with KPIs, filters, and scheduled refreshes, reducing manual reporting effort.


## Professional Experiences

**Data Engineer, Jarvis Consulting Group (2025 - Present)**: Worked on backend and data engineering projects using Java, Linux, Bash, SQL, Docker, and PostgreSQL.
