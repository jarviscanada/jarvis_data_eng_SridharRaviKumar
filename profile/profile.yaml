# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Data Engineering professional with hands-on experience building backend 
  applications and data processing systems at Jarvis Consulting Group.
  I have worked with Java, Linux, Bash, Docker, PostgreSQL, and SQL to build
  tools such as a containerized Java Grep application and a Linux cluster
  monitoring system.
  Previously at Cognizant, I worked on downstream data processing using
  COBOL-based batch programs, handled file-based data flows, supported
  month-end operations, and created productivity reports.
  I enjoy understanding systems end-to-end, writing clear code, and improving
  reliability through better design and data structure choices.
